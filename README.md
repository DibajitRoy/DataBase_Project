# DataBase_Project
The Restaurant Management System (RMS) is a complete MySQL-based database project designed to organize and automate core restaurant operations. It covers the full database development process, including ER diagram design, 1NF–3NF normalization, table creation, data insertion, and query testing. The system manages key entities such as restaurants, customers, orders, food items, waiters, managers, chefs, and bills, along with their relationships. Various SQL operations such as simple queries, aggregate queries, joins, subqueries, and views are implemented to analyze and retrieve data effectively. The project also includes a Java–MySQL connection to demonstrate real-time communication between the application and the database. Overall, this RMS project provides a structured, efficient, and practical demonstration of how relational databases can support restaurant management.
